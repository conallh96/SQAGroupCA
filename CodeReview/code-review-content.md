# Code Reviews #
## Introduction ## 

**Code review** is a systematic examination of source code often from new features added by a dev team. The review is usually conducted by **peers** within the organisation and is intended to **find and fix** mistakes often overlooked in the initial development stage, improving both the overall **quality of software** and the **skills of the developer**.

## Checklist ##
While reviewing code made by you or your colleagues there are generally a few questions you can ask yourself about the code.

1. Am I able to **understand** the code easily?
2. Is the code written following the **coding standards** and **guidelines**?
3. Is the same code **duplicated** more than twice?
4. Can I **unit test/ debug** the code easily to find the root cause?
5. Is this function or class **too big**? If yes, is the function or class doing **too much**?

If you find the answer is yes to any of the above questions then you can leave a comment with a suggestion of what to *alter* or *change*.

## What Makes A Good Checklist ##
You might find yourself asking what makes a good checklist and what separates the good review checklists from the ineffective ones.

1. A good checklist helps the reviewers task move much quicker and review in a more reliable and consistent way by reducing the overall amount of information that the reviewer needs to remember in order to correctly anaylse and compare the findings with the associated checklist. It focuses on top-priority issues and doesnâ€™t exert the reviewer with too many tasks.

2. A bad checklist encourages nitpicking and creates an unhealthy relationship between colleagues which may be percieved in a condescending manner.It also can ignore the importance of velocity, and unintentionally hinder the progress of the team. If the checklist is cumbersome, redundant with other processes, or not consistently applicable and relevant, it can become a great waste of time and resources and authors and reviewers will tend to completely ignore without guilt or hesitation, feeding into an unhealthy atmosphere.
