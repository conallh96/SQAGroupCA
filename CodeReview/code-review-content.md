# Code Reviews #
## Introduction ## 

**Code review** is a systematic examination of source code often from new features added by a dev team. The review is usually conducted by **peers** within the organisation and is intended to **find and fix** mistakes often overlooked in the initial development stage, improving both the overall **quality of software** and the **developers skills**.

## Checklist ##
While reviewing code made by you or your colleagues there are generally a few questions you can ask yourself about the code.

1. Am I able to **understand** the code easily?
2. Is the code written following the **coding standards** and **guidelines**?
3. Is the same code **duplicated** more than twice?
4. Can I **unit test/ debug** the code easily to find the root cause?
5. Is this function or class **too big**? If yes, is the function or class doing **too much**?

If you find the answer is yes to any of the above questions then you can leave a comment with a suggestion of what to *alter* or *change*.

## What Makes A Good Checklist ##
You might find yourself asking what makes a good checklist and what separates the good review checklists from the ineffective ones.

1. A good checklist helps reviewers move faster and review in a more reliable and consistent manner by reducing the amount of information that the reviewer needs to remember and carry in their head. It focuses on the highest-priority issues and doesn’t overwhelm the reviewer with too much to do.

2. On the other hand, a bad checklist encourages nitpicking, ignores the importance of velocity, and unintentionally hinders progress. If the checklist is overbearing, redundant with other processes, or not consistently applicable, it can become useless—something code authors and reviewers will tend to completely ignore without guilt or hesitation.
