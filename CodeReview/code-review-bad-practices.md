# Bad Practices
While Code Reviews can be a good opportunity to fix or improve a product as well as improve the skills of the developer, they can often create negative relationships between developers and their seniors due to adoption of some common bad practices. Senior members of development teams often use Code Review to impose unrealistic demands and this can result in frustrated developers and decreased productivity.

## Reviewer Inconsistency
When submitting a piece of code for review, a developer's work is subject to the review of a number of members of the development team. If there is no agreed upon approach to code reviewing, for example a checklist, reviewers can often give feedback with contradicting views and suggestions that result in the developer running back and forth to refactor code to meet each reviewers specofic desired style or standard.
For example, a developer may implement a new feature available in the Java library that allows them to complete a task with much fewer lines of code. This work may be praised by some more forward thinking developers however a less up to speed or perhaps more traditional developer may consider it unclear or over complex. Receiver differing feedback and suggestions due to no fixed coding standard and review process will lead to the developer being uncertain of their work and frustrated wth their progress.

## Overwhelming Feedback
When giving negative feedback, it is important to present it in a fair and contructive way in order to avoid overhelming team members and harming their confidence. Some reviewers tend to spend the reviewing process flagging every instance of every error, leaving copious amounts of comments criticizing the developer's work. This creates a tense environment in within the team which can easily be avoided by taking a more constructive approach to reviewing the piece of code. If there is an error in the developer's work, it is likely it will be repeated a number o fti mes as they thougt it was an appropriate way to complete the task. A clear and concise explaination of the error and how to solve it in the place of the first instance will allow the developer to undertsand and learn from the issue rather than bog them down with criticism. This will enable the code reviewing process to create a  positive environment of education and improvement rather than one of tension and negativity.
