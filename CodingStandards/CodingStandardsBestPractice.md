# Best Coding Standards

It is crucial for a developersâ€™ team to have proper coding conventions and standards to guide them during the development. The best coding standards are short, simple and concise rules. They should be black and white instead of vague suggestions or recommendations. Some common aspects of coding standard are below:

- ### Naming Conventions

The naming convention is how your packages, classes methods, variables, etc. should be named (eg. camelCase, PascalCase or snake_case). This should be consistent throughout the code as it will improve readability.

- ### Formatting and Indentation

There are different indentation styles available to be followed so it is essential to maintain a consistent indentation style throughout your code.

- ### Commenting and Documenting

Your code should be well documented. Commenting your code and providing proper documentation makes it easy for the reviewer to better understand the codes methods and declarations.

- ### Testing

Teams should have a specific approach and tools that should be used to test the codes. This way you know what your method does, what it takes and what it should return. You will know when it should work or when it should fail.


- ###	Avoid using an identifier for multiple purposes
Each variable should have a descriptive and meaningful name indicating the reason behind using it. This is not possible if an identifier is used for multiple purposes and thus it can lead to confusion.

- ###	Length of Functions 
As functions get longer they are more difficult to understand. Functions should be small enough to carry out small work and lengthy functions should be broken into small ones for completing small tasks.
