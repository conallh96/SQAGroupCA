# Coding Standards

## Introduction to Coding Standards

Coding standards (also known as coding conventions) are a set of rules and guidelines that recommend programming style, procedures and methods for a specific programming language. Coding standards ensure that software is: 

* Safe – *to be used without causing harm*
* Secure – *cannot be hacked*
* Reliable – *functions as it should*
* Testable – *can be tested at code level*
* Maintainable – *easy to maintain as it grows*
* Portable – *works the same in every environment*

Coding standards can sometimes have a "stigma" around them in which they sometimes cannot leave room for developers to exercise their own creativity.
Coding style is very personal and varies from individual to individual. Effective coding standards should focus on techniques that highlight problems and make bugs stand-out rather than an individuals personal preferences. Coding standards, when used in the right manner, offer many benefits.

## Benefits of Coding Standards

- ### Increases Efficiency

It has been observed that software developers spend a large amount of their time resolving issues. Implementing coding standards enables development teams to detect problems early or even prevent them entirely. This will increase efficiency throughout the software process.

- ### Easier Maintenance

Coding standard gives a uniform appearance to the codes written by different developers. If the code is consistent, it improves readability and can be easily maintained. This is because anyone can understand it and make modifications at any point in time.

- ### Reduces Complexity

The higher the complexity of a code, the more vulnerable it is to errors.
If coding standards are maintained properly, then the code increases readability and understandability, thus it reduces the complexity of the code.

- ### Cost Saving

Consistent code leads to a clear view which in turn can give the developers an opportunity to reuse the code whenever required. This can drastically reduces the cost and development efforts.

- ### Bug Rectifications

A consistent source code makes it easy to locate and correct bugs in the software.

## Best Coding Standards

It is crucial for a developers’ team to have proper coding conventions and standards to guide them during the development. The best coding standards are short, simple and concise rules. They should be black and white instead of vague suggestions or recommendations. Some common aspects of coding standard are below:

- ### Naming Conventions

The naming convention is how your packages, classes methods, variables, etc. should be named (eg. camelCase, PascalCase or snake_case). This should be consistent throughout the code as it will improve readability.

- ### Formatting and Indentation

There are different indentation styles available to be followed so it is essential to maintain a consistent indentation style throughout your code.

- ### Commenting and Documenting

Your code should be well documented. Commenting your code and providing proper documentation makes it easy for the reviewer to better understand the codes methods and declarations.

- ### Testing

Teams should have a specific approach and tools that should be used to test the codes. This way you know what your method does, what it takes and what it should return. You will know when it should work or when it should fail.


- ###	Avoid using an identifier for multiple purposes
Each variable should have a descriptive and meaningful name indicating the reason behind using it. This is not possible if an identifier is used for multiple purposes and thus it can lead to confusion.

- ###	Length of Functions 
As functions get longer they are more difficult to understand. Functions should be small enough to carry out small work and lengthy functions should be broken into small ones for completing small tasks.
