# Bad Practices
As it is important to know and adhere to the best coding standards  
it also as important to know and avoid bad coding standards.

- ### Poor or no commenting of code
Commenting code is vital for team cohesion as code is not always self explanatory without the use of meaningful comments to explain in particular more complex code.  
It will make life more difficult than it needs to be for those reviewing and those who may have to work on that part of the code base in future.

- ### No rules for Styling
This can often be a factor that is seen as not being that important but not having a style guide  
can lead to inconsistencies of the readability throughout a project and issues such as [Spaghetti Code](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/spaghetti-code/#:~:text=Spaghetti%20code%20is%20a%20pejorative,your%20code%20to%20be%20less).

- ### Bad time management
This becomes an issue when the length time to implement a feature has been underestimated this can lead to costly delays.  
When coming up time estimates it is essential both consult more experienced developers on the project and to have regular code reviews to ensure the schedule is maintained or updated as needed.
