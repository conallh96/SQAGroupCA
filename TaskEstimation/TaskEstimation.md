## Methods of Estimation

### Story Points
Story points are a popular method of task estimation within the SCRUM framework as they allow teams to measure tasks by the most relevant unit to their process as possible. To some teams a story point may be one hour, to others it may be one month, the main requirement being that this chosen unit is consistent throughout the team. The amount of effort required to complete a task can then be represented by a value that all members of the team, regardless of their skillset, can comprehend. With a consistent system in place, teams can use past estimations as references for future sprint planning.
