## Introduction 
When operating within a SCRUM framework, consitent task estimation is required in order to be able to plan accurately and reliable from a shared group viewpoint.
Task Estimation takes place during the Sprint Planning Meeting and focusses on the time and resources required to complete the tasks in the sprint and how to accurately measure these tasks.
There are many practiced methods or task estimation in SCRUM including the following popular choices.

## Story Points
Story points are the most popular method of task estimation within the SCRUM framework as they allow teams to measure tasks by the most relevant unit to their process as possible. To some teams a story point may be one hour, to others it may be one month, the main requirement being that this chosen unit is consistent throughout the team. The amount of effort required to complete a task can then be represented by a value that all members of the team, regardless of their skillset, can comprehend. With a consistent system in place, teams can use past estimations as references for future sprint planning.

## Methods of Estimation
Once an appropriate unit for assigning Story Points to tasks has been assigned, there are a number of ways a team can agree on how many points should be assigned to a task.

### Planning Poker
When estimating the effort and resources required to complete a task, the team are all handed cards showing the varying values of story points tasks can be assigned. Each member of the team is asked to reveal the amount of points they believe the task should be assigned at the same time. This will result in a range values throughout the group and a discussion as to why members believe the task will take as long as they have stated. In the end, the team can come to a compromised consensus as to how many Story Points to assign the task.

### T-Shirt Sizing
When getting to grips with Agile methodology or working with relatively simple tasks, t-shirt sizing can be a conveient method of estimating the effort needed to complete a task. Sizes such as extra small up to extra extra large are assigned to task in accordance to their complexity and effort demanded, allowing the team to clearly identify the largest and most pressing tasks in a sprint. This simple method is an excellent way to introduce your team to analysing tasks and estimating their effort and resources involved.
