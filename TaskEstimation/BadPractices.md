# Bad Practices
## Introduction
As it's extremely useful to know the correct ways of task estimation its also important to know the bad practices that go along with it.
## Common Issues
### Easily Misused
Since story points can be frequently misunderstood, they are easily misused also. Managers can think they are a measurement of the amount of work or effectiveness of a team. This can lead to terrible situations where managers are comparing teams to one another by using their velocity as a benchmark which can lead to undermining of groups or individuals.
### Encourage The Wrong Focus
Teams can continually increase their estimations, which can make a mockery of the process and can be considered “fake” estimations. It can encourage teams to rush their work and mark stories as done when they aren’t quite finished. It can encourage teams to focus on numbers and output, instead of value and outcomes.
### Time Consuming
The main method of point estimation is Planning Poker. Sessions can take 1-2 hours. I experienced this myself while on internship with DEASP. The sessions sometimes took longer than 2 hours and had to split up into multiple meetings.
### Sacrificing Quality for Predictability 
Technical practices like test-driven development and refactoring are often the first things to be dropped when someone is trying to maker their estimate. The emphasis here being placed on a team completing all their work by the time estimate but often doing so by sacrificing quality.
