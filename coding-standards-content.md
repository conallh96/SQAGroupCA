# Coding Standards

## Introduction to Coding Standards

Coding standards (also known as coding conventions) are a set of rules and guidelines that recommend programming style, procedures and methods for a specific programming language. Coding standards ensure that software is: 

* Safe – *to be used without causing harm*
* Secure – *cannot be hacked*
* Reliable – *functions as it should*
* Testable – *can be tested at code level*
* Maintainable – *easy to maintain as it grows*
* Portable – *works the same in every environment*

Coding standards can sometimes have a "stigma" around them in which they sometimes cannot leave room for developers to exercise their own creativity.
Coding style is very personal and varies from individual to individual. Effective coding standards should focus on techniques that highlight problems and make bugs stand-out rather than an individuals personal preferences. Coding standards, when used in the right manner, offer many benefits.
