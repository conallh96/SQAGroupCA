# Project Plan:

## Team Members:
- Conall Hunt 
- Chloe Dunne 
- Paul Langtry 
- Ronan Macken 

## Topics:
- Introduction (Ronan Macken)
- Task Estimation (Conall Hunt, Paul Langtry)
- Coding Standards (Chloe Dunne, Ronan Macken)
- Code Reviews (Paul Langtry, Conall Hunt)
- Plan & Style Guide (Ronan Macken)

## Project Steps:
1. Conall creates the repository and both the develop and master branches.
2. The rest of the team then clones this repository to their local machines.
3. Each team member will then checkout the develop branch.
4. Each team member will then create a feature branch off of develop relevant to their topic.
5. The team will then make commits to their feature branches and push their changes.
6. After pushing changes each member will make pull request for said changes and assign the rest of the team as reviewers.
7. The pull request must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before merging into the develop branch.
8. Once the handbook is complete the team will review the document and process
 and then create a release branch which will be merged into master.

## Style Guide + File Structure:
- Each page header should be H1.
- Other headings should be H2.
- Bullet points should be used for further sub-headings.
- Each page should contain links to the Home page and other topics.
- All content should be left aligned for consistency.
- Links to references should available at the end of each page.
- Each topic should be contained in its own folder.
- Images should be placed in the images folder.

## Retrospective 

- When we originally set up the project repository on GitHub, we all forked from a main repository created by Ronan and proceeded to clone our own repositories onto our systems.  
Upon further consideration, we realized we should all have cloned from the same repository,  
Conall then set up a new repository and the other members cloned.  
This was a minor set back in the early stages but luckily we discovered our errors early on.  
This mistake was mainly down to our lack of experience on group repositories but provided us with a good lesson in initializing repositories that multiple members will be working on.

- As a group we could have improved on the commenting and reviews on pull requests through github.  
We only learned late on how to could approve requests instead of just leaving comments.


- Overall we worked well as a team and helped each other along when any of us were unsure of the next steps. We planned regular calls to discuss any issues and organize the work and kept to our schedule.
