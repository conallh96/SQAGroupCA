## Project Steps:
1. Conall creates the repository and both the develop and master branches.
2. The rest of the team then clones this repository to their local machines.
3. Each team member will then checkout the develop branch.
4. Each team member will then create a feature branch off of develop relevant to their topic.
5. The team will then make commits to their feature branches and push their changes.
6. After pushing changes each member will make pull request for said changes and assign the rest of the team as reviewers.
7. The pull request must be reviewed and approved by everyone before merging into the develop branch.
8. Once the handbook is complete the team will review the document and process
 and then create a release branch which will be merged into master.
